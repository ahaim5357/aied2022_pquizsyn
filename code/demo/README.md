## Demo Scripts

This repository contains code for the algorithm PQuizSyn, introduced in the paper ["Adaptive Scaffolding in Block-Based Programming
via Synthesizing New Tasks as Pop Quizzes"](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/files/papers/aied2022_pquizsyn_preprint.pdf).

### Overview
We present two scripts as a demo:
* ```run_fig1.py```: Generates the reference task, solution code, and student attempt shown in Fig. 1 of the paper. 
It also generates a popquiz for the scenario. The popquiz contains a task, a code with a blank, and quiz options.

* ```run_fig5.py```: Generates the reference task, solution code, and student attempt shown in Fig. 5 of the paper. 
It also generates a popquiz for the scenario. The popquiz contains a task, a code with a blank, and quiz options.
