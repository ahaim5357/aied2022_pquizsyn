## Overview of Data generated

We have the following folders in which data is generated:
* ```demo/``` : In this folder, all the data from running the ```code/demo``` scripts is generated.
* ```input/``` : In this folder, all the data from running the ```code/step0_inputdata``` scripts is generated.
* ```output/``` : In this folder, all the data from running the full pipeline on all tasks is generated.

Some of the routines also generate ```temp_misc/``` folders to process different intermediate json code files. When images are generated, additionally the routines generate a ```temp_latex/``` folder to output the log files during pdf generation.
